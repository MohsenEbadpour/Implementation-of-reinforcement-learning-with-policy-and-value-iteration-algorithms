# Implementation of reinforcement learning with policy and value iteration algorithms
The source code is an implementation of reinforcement learning with policy and value iteration algorithms for minimum distance problems. The solved problem is the minimum distance on a grid space. Value function and found policy are shown below.

### Note
This code was written as my Machine Learning course's assignment in the fall of 2021, so it may have some bugs to fix or be coded more optimally.
